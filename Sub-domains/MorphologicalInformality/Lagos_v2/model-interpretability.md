# Morphological Informality

Morphological Informality is a dataset focused on mapping the difference between formally planned and informally planned areas of cities as an indication of urban deprivation. The levels of ‚Äúmorphological informality‚Äù are classified as **Low morphological informality, Medium morphological informality, or High morphological informality**. Generally, higher levels of informality are related to more deprived areas.

## Main Indicators of Morphological Informality

The dataset combines three main indicators of morphological informality: Building Density and Arrangements, Road Arrangements, and Population Density.

Together, these indicators help predict the level of informality ‚Äî> **Low, Medium, or High.**

For each indicator (Buildings, Roads, and Population), our modellers used a set of parameters to classify the data into the categories of Low, Medium, and High. Below, we describe those parameters.

### Buildings

*Low*
<blockquote > Buildings are large, detached from each other with formal arrangements and low density of at least 500 buildings per km2.</blockquote>

*Medium*
<blockquote> Buildings are small and dense OR have variable building arrangements with moderate density of at least 1,500 buildings per km2.</blockquote>

*High*
<blockquote > Buildings are small and dense OR have variable building arrangements with moderate density of at least 1,500 buildings per km2.</blockquote>

### Roads

*Low*
<blockquote> Roads are paved and wide with uniform paths. The paved road density is at least 1.25 km per km2.</blockquote>

*Medium*
<blockquote>There are both paved and unpaved roads, with a combination of planned and unplanned paths. The paved road density is at least 0.76 km per km2.</blockquote>

*High*

<blockquote>Paths and roads are narrow and unpaved. The paved road density is at least 0.3 km per km2.</blockquote>

üí° Together, these indicators combine to form the different classifications of morphological informality that you see reflected in the grid cells on our map.
