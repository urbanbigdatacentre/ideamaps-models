#  Deploying the Morphological Informality Model (V3)



This folder contains all required code to model morphological informality based on building footprint data.

We refer to our publication for a detailed description of the methodology: [preprint](). 




## 🛠️ Setup


1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/ideamaps-models.git
    cd ideamaps-models/Sub-domains/MorphologicalInformality/Sourcecode/V3
    ```


2. **Create a virtual environment using Conda**:
    ```
    conda env create ideamaps-models python=3.10
    conda activate ideamaps-models
    ```
3. **Install dependencies from requirements.txt file** using pip
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
