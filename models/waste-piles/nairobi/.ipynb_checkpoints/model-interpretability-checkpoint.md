# **Accumulated Waste Piles**

This dataset shows the chance of finding piles of waste in different places. Waste piles can mean that waste collection services are not working well. Areas with more waste piles are often more disadvantaged and may not have regular waste collection.

The dataset groups places into three levels based on how likely you are to find waste piles: Low, Medium, and High. In general, areas with a high chance of waste accumulation may have fewer services and bigger waste problems.

## **Waste Accumulation Probability Levels:**
Unlikely to see waste piles in this area.
But low does not always mean cleanâ€”it might also mean no data was available for this place.

### **ðŸŸ¢ Low (probability of 0 â€“ 2.4%):**  
A value of low means it is unlikely to see accumulated waste on the street. It also might indicate that there is no data avaiable in this area, but it might is not no waste in this area.

### **ðŸŸ¡ Medium (2.5% â€“ 16.4%):**  
Some chance of seeing waste on the street.
Waste may be there, but not always in large amounts.

### **ðŸ”´ High (16.4% â€“ 100%):**  
Very likely to see waste piles.
This might mean waste is not collected properly or people dump waste near the main road.

--------------

This dataset will help the local community and city planners understand where waste is piling up. The goal is to use this information to improve waste collection services and make the area cleaner and healthier for everyone.
