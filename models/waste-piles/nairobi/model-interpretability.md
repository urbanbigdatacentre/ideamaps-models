# **Accumulated Waste Piles**

This dataset shows the chance of finding piles of waste in different places. Waste piles can mean that waste collection services are not working well. Areas with more waste piles are often more disadvantaged and may not have regular waste collection.

The dataset groups places into three levels based on how likely you are to find waste piles: Low, Medium, and High. In general, areas with a high chance of waste accumulation may have fewer services and bigger waste problems.

## **Waste Accumulation Probability Levels:**

### **ðŸŸ¢ Low (probability of 0 â€“ 2.4%):**  
- **Unlikely** to see waste piles in this area.  
- But low does not always mean cleanâ€”it might also mean **no data** was available for this place.
- **Your feedback** is still very important! If you know there is waste in an area marked as "Low," telling us helps improve the data.

### **ðŸŸ¡ Medium (2.5% â€“ 16.4%):**  
- **Some chance** of seeing waste on the street.  
- Waste may be there, but **not always in large amounts**.  
- This type of waste is more likely to be **temporary**. People may pile waste near the street on purpose so that **waste collection companies can pick it up** for proper management.

### **ðŸ”´ High (16.4% â€“ 100%):**  
- **Very likely** to see waste piles.  
- This might mean waste is **not collected properly** or people dump waste near the main road.  
- Waste is **often** dumped without proper collection, leading to constant piles that turn into informal dumping sites with **little to no management**.

This dataset will help the local community and city planners understand where waste is piling up. The goal is to use this information to improve waste collection services and make the area cleaner and healthier for everyone.
