    "## Abstract\n",
    "The rapid growth of urban areas has put substantial pressure on local services and infrastructure, particularly in African cities. With migrants moving into cities and transient households moving within cities, traditional means of collecting data (e.g., censuses and household surveys) are inadequate and often overlook informal settlements and households. As a consequence, there is a chronic lack of basic data about deprived households and entire settlements. Given that urban poor residents rely predominantly on private and informal service providers for healthcare and other services, they are rarely captured in routine service data, including health information management systems. This is even more critical for women in need of maternal health care. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the different phases of maternity: antenatal care, interpartern or delivery, and postnatal care, the team decided to focus on interpartern or delivery phase being the most critical. The intertwined relationship between maternal health care and urban deprivation has been documented and described in the literature [Abascal et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101770). The IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem team aims to analyse the conditions in which vulnerable communities relate to emergency maternal care (EmOC) in the city of Kano. To do so, the analysis is divided into three main components: \n",
    "1. **EmOC Offer**: Based on the geospatial database of travel times [(Macharia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02651-9) and the team's field validation, we characterised 145 HC facilities offering EmOC in Kano, their service levels and relative costs.\n",
    "2. **EmOC Accessibility**: The team used different routing services, including the OSM-based openrouteservice API, to calculate the travel times to the nearest EmOC facility for each 100x100m grid cell in Kano. \n",
    "3. **EmOC Demand**: The team discussed a set of socio-economic factors that determine the way communities from slums and other deprived areas demand or interact with EmOC services such as available income, employment, education, age, medical practitioners' age and gender as well as religious beliefs and social practices. despite not having access to specific data, the team discussed the potential impacts on demand for EmOC services in Kano based on these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook gives an overview of the distribution of centres offering EmOC in Kano, their classification and how they can be accessed by car. Open source data from OpenStreetMap and tools (such as the openrouteservice) were used to create accessibility measures such as travel times and isochrones. Spatial analysis and other data analytics functions led to generating outputs within the 100x100m grid cells that categorised them into three levels: low, medium, and high.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Preprocessing**: Get data for EmOC facilities.\n",
    "* **Analysis for Offer**:\n",
    "    * Filter and classify EmOC facilities based on discussed criteria.\n",
    "    * Visualise EmOC faccilities in their categories.\n",
    "* **Analysis for Accessibility**:\n",
    "    * Compute travel times to facilities using openrouteservice API or other routing services.\n",
    "    * Generate areas for low, medium and high categories based on discussed criteria.\n",
    "* **Analysis for Demmand**:\n",
    "    * Derive socio-economic descriptors based on discussed criteria.\n",
    "* **Result**: Visualize results as maps and export model outputs.\n",
    "\n",

    "This study integrates various Python geospatial analysis libraries and packages to support spatial data processing, visualization, and isochrone generation. The os module is used to interact with the operating system, managing file paths and reading environment variables such as API keys. folium library along with its MarkerCluster plugin, facilitates the creation of interactive maps for visualizing large-scale geospatial data. The openrouteservice.client serves as an interface to the OpenRouteService API, enabling the extraction of isochrones. pandas library for data analysis, provides functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data, while fiona supports reading and writing real-world data using multi-layered GIS formats, such as shapefiles. The shapely package is employed for the manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects."
