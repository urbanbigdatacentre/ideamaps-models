# üè• Deploying the Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) Access Deprivation Model ‚Äì Lagos

This folder contains all required code and input data to assess emergency maternal care (EmOC) access deprivation for Lagos, Nigeria, using a spatial model based on the 2-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method.

We refer to our publication for a detailed description of the methodology: [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dGsay3PzLPfFJ8P2z702lm-oXsCebGyoMiSjkgl5jr4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.xm1wdqmjz1kd).

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `EmOC-Access-Deprivation-Lagos.ipynb`: Main notebook to run the 2SFCA access model.
- `EmOC-Access-Deprivation-Lagos.py`: Python script version of the model.
- `Lagos/data_inputs/`: Contains all required input data.
- `Lagos/data_temp/`: Temporary files created during intermediate processing steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/ideamaps-models.git
   
   cd ideamaps-models/models/emergency-maternal-care/scripts
2. **Create a virtual environment**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    
    activate .venv/bin/activate
3. **Install dependencies from requirements.txt file using pip**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Set up the Jupyter kernel (for VS Code or Jupyter Notebooks)**

   ```bash
   pip install -U ipykernel
   
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=.venv

## üìä Data Sources

### 1. **Study Area**  
   The IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem grid files for Nairobi, Kenya, Lagos, Nigeria, and Kano, Nigeria, are available in [here](https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/ideamaps-models/tree/dev/docs/study-areas) alongside a documentation of the grids.  
   **Format**: GeoPackage

### 2. **Population Grid**  
   Gridded data (1km resolution) representing women of childbearing age (15‚Äì49 years), sourced from [WorldPop Nigeria](https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=18447).  
   **Format**: GeoTIFF

### 3. **Healthcare Facilities**  
   Based on the geospatial database of travel times to healthcare facilities by [Macharia et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22689667.v2), the classification for validation is determine based on the ownership.  
   **Format**: GeoPackage or CSV (with facility attributes and coordinates)

## üöÄ Running the Model

Follow these steps to obtain lack of Emergency Obstetric Care accessibility levels (low, medium, high).

### 1. **Open the notebook:**  
   `EmOC-Access-Deprivation-Lagos.ipynb`

### 2. **Configure input paths:**  
   Ensure all input paths are correctly set in the notebook.

### 3. **Aggregate population data:**  
   Aggregate the population data from a 1 km grid to a 100 m √ó 100 m resolution using [Google Building Footprints](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GOOGLE_Research_open-buildings_v3_polygons).

### 4. **Calculate OD Matrix Using OpenRouteService (ORS) Matrix API**  

   Includes estimated travel times and distances from each population grid centroid to the healthcare facility. There are two options for computing travel time and distance:

   - **Option A: Public ORS API**

     Requires an API key from [openrouteservice.org](https://openrouteservice.org/).

     ```bash
     OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
     api_key = os.getenv('OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY')
     client = openrouteservice.Client(key=api_key)
     ```

   - **Option B: Local ORS Instance of the ORS server**

### 5. **Applying the Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) Method**

   - **Catchment definition** ‚Äî For each facility, a surrounding area is defined using a travel time threshold.

   - **Supply-to-demand ratio calculation** ‚Äî The capacity of the facility is divided by the population within its catchment.

   - **Aggregation** ‚Äî For each demand location (a grid cell with population count), accessibility scores are calculated by summing the ratios of nearby facilities within its own catchment.

Note: Ensure all data preprocessing steps are complete and the required input files are available.
