#  Deploying the Road Access Deprivation Model (V1)



This folder contains all required code to model lack of road accessibility based on road network and building footprint data.

We refer to our publication for a detailed description of the methodology: [preprint](). 




## üõ†Ô∏è Setup


1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/ideamaps-models.git
    cd ideamaps-models/models/road-access-deprivation/scripts
    ```


2. **Create a virtual environment using Conda**:
    ```
    conda env create ideamaps-models python=3.9
    conda activate ideamaps-models
    ```
3. **Install dependencies from requirements.txt file** using pip
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## üèöÔ∏è Prepare the Data

Our model requires roads data with surface type (paved/unpaved) information and building footprints as inputs.

There are several providers for open building footprint data. We recommend using data from the [Overture Map Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/).


## ‚öôÔ∏è Run Model

Follow these steps to obtain lack of road accessibility levels (low, medium, high).

1. **Compute the model parameters at the building level**

   ```
   python model_parameters.py -r *roads file* -t *road type attribute* -k *road type key for paved roads* -b *buildings file* -o *output file*
   ```

   The road file has to include a road type attribute indicating whether a road segment is paved or unpaved. The value of the road type attribute of paved roads is defined using the road type key argument. Roads with other values than the parsed key are considered unpaved.


2. **Aggregate the building-level model parameters to the grid level**

   ```
   python aggregation.py -b *building footprints file (.parquet)* -g *grid file* -o *output file (.parquet)*
   ```
    The IDEAMAPS grid files for Nairobi, Kenya, Lagos, Nigeria, and Kano, Nigeria, are stored in [this folder](https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/ideamaps-models/tree/dev/docs/study-areas) alongside a documentation of the grids.


3. **Postprocessing (optional)**

   *Not implemented yet*: Improve the model by considering natural barriers.

   ```
   python aggregation.py -m *path to the morphometrics dir* -b *path to the builidng footprints file* -g *path to the grid file* -o *path the the output dir*
   ```
