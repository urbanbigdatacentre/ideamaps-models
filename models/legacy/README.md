# Legacy Models

This folder contains directories for models developed by the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem team. The models within this folder are no longer active on our platform. 

This folder therefore serves as an archive for sourcecode, outputs and documentation for these models.

> Please note that documentation for legacy models may be incomplete. Get in touch with repository owners for more information.
