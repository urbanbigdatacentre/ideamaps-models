# Dataset Example

Morphological Informality is a dataset focused on mapping the difference between formally planned and informally planned areas of cities as an indication of urban deprivation. The levels of ‚Äúmorphological informality‚Äù are classified as **Low morphological informality, Medium morphological informality, or High morphological informality**. Generally, higher levels of informality are related to more deprived areas.

üí° This page will help you understand more about how the classifications of Low - Medium - High are predicted in our data model.

## Definitions of Levels

The dataset relates the form, structure, and arrangement of buildings and roads to informality.
Together, these indicators help predict the level of morphological informality ‚Äî> **Low, Medium, or High.**

Our modellers defined a set of rules based on the morphology of buildings and roads to classify the data into the categories Low, Medium, and High.

Below, we give the adopted definitions of the morphological deprivation levels.


### Low
<blockquote > Buildings are larger, detached from one another, and regularly arranged. It is easy to visualise roads, pathways, or open spaces between them. Areas with no buildings are also categorised as low. </blockquote>

### Medium
<blockquote> Buildings are small and close together (it can be hard to visualise roads, pathways, or spaces between them) OR buildings are irregularly arranged (with varying alignment to neighbouring structures). Roads are moderately present. </blockquote>

### High
<blockquote > Buildings are small and close together AND buildings are irregularly arranged (with varying alignment to neighbouring structures). Roads are hard to visualise or they are absent. </blockquote>

üí° Together, the morphology of buildings and roads form the different levels of morphological informality that you see reflected in the grid cells on our map.
