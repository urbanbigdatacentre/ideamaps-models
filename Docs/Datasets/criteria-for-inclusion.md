# Criteria for Inclusion of Datasets on the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem Platform

In Year 3 of the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem project, working groups for each of our pilot cities will identify and select new datasets to be included in the data ecosystem. These datasets will be processed and ingested in the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem tool and validated with communities and other social groups, afterwards being used to support the co-creation of Community Action Plans and City Action Plans. 

For the pilot cities, the process of identification and selection of datasets will be led by our city-focused working groups, but in the future, the criteria can be adapted for use in a procedure of nomination and review of new datasets to be included.



The criteria below will be used by the city working groups as a reference when discussing the inclusion of datasets from different sources:

1. Outputs from models developed within our IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem project
2. Model outputs developed by external partners
3. Datasets from external partners.

We identified the following criteria in line with the main principles of our “double loop” co-creation process:


## 10 Criteria
#### Grounded
1. The data is current, responds to community priorities and does not cause harm to the community. This will be assessed based on the community and stakeholder priorities and concerns collected in Years 1-2 of our project, which will be summarised in a report.

2. The dataset has an explanation for a general audience. This will be documented through metadata and documentation, for which a template is openly available.

3. The categories used in the dataset are understandable and verifiable by communities and other stakeholders. The description of each category will be part of the dataset documentation.

#### Transformative/Actionable

4. There is an identified pathway for the validated data to benefit communities. A description of how the validation will add value to the dataset and how it is intended to support change that benefits communities should be included in the dataset documentation and made visible to users of the platform.

#### Transferable

5. (Optional/desirable criteria) Can be comparable across cities (e.g. through standardised indicators such as the SDGs, following FAIR principles, and using reproducible methodology). This will be an optional criteria, as we may still allow city-specific datasets which fulfil particularly well the other criteria.

#### Feasible:

6. The data can be gridded in the chosen reference grid and coordinate system for the pilot cities. Documentation about the grid system and coordinate reference systems are openly available in the [Study Areas directory](../StudyArea).

7. The dataset covers the whole reference urban area (i.e., at the moment defined by a combination of functional urban area and admin boundary for each pilot city). Reference area boundaries and further information are openly available in the [Study Areas directory](../StudyArea).

8. The dataset uses 3-point (e.g., Low, Medium, High) or binary categories (e.g., 0,1). More information about the format of the data is available in the [dataset-format.md](dataset-format.md) file. 

9. The dataset has metadata outlining the name, description, city, subdomain, and licensing information. More information about the metadata required to include a dataset can be found in the [dataset-metadata.md](dataset-metadata.md) file.

10. The data has a license that enables it to be presented on the platform. More information about the licensing requirements can be found in the [dataset-licensing.md](dataset-licensing.md) file.
