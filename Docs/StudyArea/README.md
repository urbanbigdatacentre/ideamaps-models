# Study Area definition

This file describes criteria used to define the tree main study areas for the [IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem](https://www.ideamapsdataecosystem.org). The description includes key technical elements considered such as the reference grid, the administrative boundaries, functional urban areas, and the Coordinate Reference System (CRS). Each of these elements aims at enabling interoperability of the project's model outputs with third party global datasets such as world population estimations and national statitsitcs. Also, the study areas and the gridded data format were designed and defined aiming at protecting vulnerable communities and keeping their privacy. The criteria and details are described in detail below.

## Reference Grid

The selection of a reference grid aimed at providing a framework hat enabled interoperability for datasets about deptivation generated by the IDEAMAPS team. With that in mind, the team selected the Global Human Settlement Grid Multitemporal (1975-2030) grid as the reference grid for the project. This grid is a global spatial database that provides multidimensional information on human settlements, expressed as the number of people per cell. The GHS-POP grid is available for download at the following link: [GHS-POP](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/2ff68a52-5b5b-4a22-8f40-c41da8332cfe).

The selection of the GHS-POP grid as the reference grid for the project was based on the following criteria:

1. The GHS-POP grid is a widely used global spatial database that provides multidimensional information on human settlements. Therefore, IDEAMAPS data can be easily integrated with other global datasets.

2. The GHS-POP grid is openly available for download, which makes it accessible to the IDEAMAPS team and to other stakeholders.

3. The GHS-POP grid size (100m x 100m) suits the project aims at protecting vulnerable communities and keeping their privacy.



## Administrative Boundaries

The data source for administrative boundaries was selected based on availability and copletness across the cities and countries our research is performed. The team required a definition of for the administrative divisions where the study areas will be located. The administrative boundaries were used as an initial input to define the study areas and to provide a framework for the analysis of the IDEAMAPS data. The administrative boundaries were obtained from the Global Administrative Areas (GADM) database, which provides spatial data for administrative areas worldwide. The GADM database is available for download at the following link: [GADM](https://gadm.org/).

The selection of the GADM database as the source for administrative boundaries was based on the following criteria:

1. The GADM database is a widely used global spatial database that provides spatial data for administrative areas worldwide. Therefore, the IDEAMAPS data can be easily integrated with other datasets such as national or local statistics.

2. The GADM database is openly available for download, which makes it accessible to the IDEAMAPS team and to other stakeholders.

## Functional Urban Area 

Despite being official, administrative boundaries may not reflect the actual patterns of human settlement or economic activity. Therefore, the team used the Functional Urban Area (FUA) as a complementary definition of the study areas. The FUA is defined by the [Joint Research Centre of the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/joint-research-centre_en) as the actual urban sprawl and human activities, encompassing the core city and economically or socially integrated surrounding regions. The FUA was obtained from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) dataset, which provides spatial data for functional urban areas worldwide. The GHSL dataset is available for download at the following link: [GHSL](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/).

The selection of the FUA dataset as the source for the functional urban areas was based on the following criteria:

1. The FUA dataset is a widely used global spatial database that provides spatial data for functional urban areas worldwide. Therefore, the IDEAMAPS data can be analysed at the urban scale and compared accross other urban areas.

2. The FUA dataset is openly available for download, which makes it accessible to the IDEAMAPS team and to other stakeholders.

## Study area definition

To accurately identify SLUMS and other deprived areas, a more precese definition of the actual urban settlements is required. Considering also the connection and interactions between different urban areas can help identify more comprehensive and accurate areas of interest. Relying only on administrative delimitations modelling urban issues can be limiting because these boundaries are usually determined by historical, political, or administrative decisions and may not necessarily reflect the actual patterns of human settlement or economic activity. The table below demonstrates that often less than half of the areas in project's cities are actually urbanised. 

*Summary of administrative extensions per study city, and of unbuilt-up areas within the administrative boundaries.*

| City | Admin. extension | Non-built-up area | % Non-built-up area|
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Nairobi | 695 km2 | 229 km2 | 32% |
| Lagos | 3.815 km2 | 2.057 km2 | 53% |
| Kano | 20.069 km2 | 18.358 km2 | 91% |


In contrast, FUAs reflects the actual urban concentrations and patterns, based on objective characteristics (i.e., travel time to the Urban Centres, area of the Urban Centres, population, and country GDP per capita). As can be seen in the figure below, the FUA does not usually follow the extension set by the administrative areas. In many cities, there are outlying urbanised areas not directly linked to the city centre. A common method to avoid discontinuity in setting boundaries of urban areas is to apply a uniform 1-kilometre buffer. This distance includes nearby non-urban regions and potential future urban expansion, ensuring peripheral urban zones are considered in planning (*Reference to be added*). The figure below also shows how a buffer area was used to finally define the study areas.

## Coordinate Reference System and Cartographic projections

Managing geospatial data requires the use of a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) to define the spatial reference of the data, also a cartographic projecton is required for map visualisation. The CRS is a coordinate-based system that allows the location of a point on the Earth's surface to be specified. While the reference grid uses a [Mollweide](https://epsg.io/54009) as the CRS and an equal area cartographic projection to ensure the grid cells are consistent in dimensions and area, the administrative boundaries and the functional urban areas use either geographic coordinates (i.e., longitude and latitude based on the [WGS 84](https://epsg.io/4326 CRS) or alternative local CRSs. Such potential discrepancies must be dealt during the modelling process. 

The IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem team is carefully managing the CRS and cartographic projections of the datasets used for modelling. The team have also agreed on providing the model outputs in the WGS 84 CRS to ensure interoperability with other global datasets.

Such a decision aims at taiking advantage of a global CRS that can easly by transformed to other CRS and projections (e.g., webmercator, UTM, or local CRSs). However, there are some constraints for the correct visualisation of the uniform reference grid. It is recommended that the users of the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem use pay special attention to the technical procedures to project and transform geospatial datasets according to well established cartographic procedures and GIS software tools.
