## Functional Urban Area
[From](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yEDGC-sv-6JIMYdSJVFrx4CsL1Q00cjJUw1olIgtAks/edit?tab=t.0)

Administrative Areas: Geographical regions defined by government boundaries, such as cities or districts, established for legal or administrative purposes.
Functional Urban Areas (FUA): Areas determined by actual urban sprawl and human activities, encompassing the core city and economically or socially integrated surrounding regions.
Using Administrative delimitations for spatial analysis in urban planning can be limiting because the boundaries are usually determined by historical, political, or administrative decisions and may not necessarily reflect the actual patterns of human settlement or economic activity. Table x demonstrates that often less than half of these areas are actually urbanised.

### Table x: Summary of administrative extensions per study city, and of unbuilt-up areas within the administrative boundaries.

In contrast, using FUA reflects the actual urban centres and patterns, based on objective characteristics (i.e., travel time to the Urban Centres, area of the Urban Centres, population, and country GDP per capita). As can be seen in Figure x, the FUA does not follow the extension set by the administrative areas.
In many cities, there are outlying urbanised areas not directly linked to the city centre. A common method is to apply a uniform 1-kilometre buffer. This distance includes nearby non-urban regions and potential future urban expansion, ensuring peripheral urban zones are considered in planning (REF). The building, road and population metrics outlined in the ensuing sections (3.2, 3.3 and 3.4) are therefore summarised within the FUA 100m grid for each pilot city (Lagos, Kano and Nairobi).
