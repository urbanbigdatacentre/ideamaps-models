## 📚 About IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem

The [IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem project](https://www.ideamapsnetwork.org/project/ideamaps-data-ecosystem) is co-designing and developing a participatory data-modelling ecosystem to produce deprived area maps routinely and accurately at scale across cities in lower and middle-income countries to support multiple local stakeholders in their decision-making.

Our ethos regarding datasets and model outputs is to centre the voices of local stakeholders and ensure that the data we use is representative of the lived experiences of the communities we serve. 

As a result - the process of validating data is integral to our work. People can explore and validate models we have developed using our [web application](https://ideamapsdataecosystem.org).

The information gathered from the validation process is used to improve the models and datasets we present.

## 📈 This Repository
`ideamaps-models` is primarily intended to store documentation, source code and outputs for model developed within the project that address different [domains of deprivation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101770). Additionally, we provide tools to deploy our models to new cities as well analyse datasets containing validation of these models.

You can find documentation about our process within the [docs](/docs) folder. Specifically, there is information on how we assess new datasets for inclusion on our web application for validation and exploration purposes.

The [models](/models) folder contains the source code, outputs and specific model documentation for each active model developed by our team. 

The [utils](/utils) folder contains helpful scripts to perform common and useful tasks relating to analysis of our datasets.


## 🌍 Available Datasets
The following is a list of our active datasets. These datasets are available for exploration using the project's [web application](https://ideamapsdataecosystem.org). Their source code and documentation is available in the respective folders.

|     Dataset Name     |      City       | Version |
|:--------------------:|:---------------:|:-------:|
| Morphological Informality | Nairobi (Kenya) |   V1    |
| Morphological Informality | Lagos (Nigeria)  |   V1    |
| Morphological Informality | Kano (Nigeria)   |   V1    |
|  Barriers to Healthcare   | Kano (Nigeria)   |  V1.1   |


## ⚙️ New Models and Datasets
We provide extensive documentation for data owners looking to deploy their models or datasets to our web application for validation and exploration purposes. This includes information on data structures, metadata requirements and supporting documentation.
