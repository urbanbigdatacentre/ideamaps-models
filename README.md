# IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem: Models of Deprivation


## üìö Introduction

The [IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem project](https://www.ideamapsnetwork.org/project/ideamaps-data-ecosystem) is co-designing and developing a participatory data-modelling ecosystem to produce deprived area maps routinely and accurately at scale across cities in lower and middle-income countries to support multiple local stakeholders in their decision-making.

In this repository, we store several model developed within the project that address different [domains of deprivation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101770), including morphological informality and barriers to healthcare. Additionally, we provide tools to deploy our models to new cities.


## üåç Available Models

The following is a list of deprivation models that have been developed within the project:

|   Domain of Deprivation   |      City       |                                                         Folder                                                          | Version | Documentation |
|:-------------------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------:|---------------|

| Morphological Informality | Lagos (Nigeria) |  [Link](https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/ideamaps-models/tree/main/Sub-domains/MorphologicalInformality/Lagos_v3)  |   V3    |               |
| Morphological Informality | Kano (Nigeria)  |  [Link](https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/ideamaps-models/tree/main/Sub-domains/MorphologicalInformality/Kano_v3)   |   V3    |               |
|  Barriers to Healthcare   | Kano (Nigeria)  | [Link](https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/ideamaps-models/tree/main/Sub-domains/BarriersHealthCareAccess/Kano_v1.1)  |  V1.1   |               |


## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Deployment


We also provide code to deploy our models to new cities. To do so, please follow the instructions available in the respective model directories.



## üó∫Ô∏è Model Validation


Our model outputs can also be validated using the [IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform](https://www.ideamapsdataecosystem.org/). The validation data will be used to iteratively improve our models.
