# Directory of Resources for Platform Datasets 

Datasets describing different aspects of urban deprivation or assets can be put forward for presentation and validation on the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform.

This directory contains documents that help clarify the expectations for those datasets.

## Directory Contents

- [README.md](README.md): This document catalogues the different resources for datasets that are uploaded to the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform.
- [dataset-format.md](dataset-format.md): This document describes the expected structure of the datasets that are uploaded to the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform. 
- [dataset-interpretability.md](dataset-interpretability.md): An example of the interpretability document that accompanies the datasets that are uploaded to the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform.
- [dataset-metadata.md](dataset-metadata.md): This document describes the expected structure of the metadata that accompanies the datasets that are uploaded to the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform.
- [dataset-metadata.json](dataset-metadata.json): This is an example of a `dataset-metadata.json` file that should accompany the datasets that are uploaded to the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform.
- [dataset-licensing.md](dataset-licensing.md): This document describes the licensing requirements for datasets that are uploaded to the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform.
- [criteria-for-inclusion.md](criteria-for-inclusion.md): This document describes the criteria for inclusion of datasets on the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform.
- [example-dataset.csv](example-dataset.csv): An example dataset that can be used to understand the expected format of datasets that are uploaded to the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform.
- [/image-examples](image-examples): A directory containing example images that should be used to guide users on the type of images that should be uploaded alongside datasets.

## Folder Example
To upload a dataset to the IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem platform, the following folder structure should be followed:

```
dataset-name
│   scripts
│   city
    │   dataset-outputs.csv
    │   dataset-metadata.json
    │   dataset-interpretability.md
    │   licensing.md
    │   image-examples
    │       │   example-model-high.png
    │       │   example-model-medium.png
    │       │   example-model-low.png
```

You can see an example of this folder structure in the [example-folder-structure](/models/example-folder-structure) directory.
